Mystery Word: A variant of Hangman, where you guess a secret word within eight tries.

#Overview

A project built with React JS, where you, the user,  have to guess a secret word generated by the computer within eight guesses. If the alphabet guessed is correct, it is filled in at the correct place in the secret word. If it is not there, the number of guesses available is reduced by one. The computer also shows all the alphabets already guessed by you, the user, for reference. 

#When the game begins: 

"I have a 6 letter word for you. Find out what it is in 8 guesses!"

"- - - - - -"


#Sample Input

An alphabet = "E" OR "A"


#Sample Output

If it is there in the word:

_E___E

Your guessed letters so far: E, A
The number of guesses you still have: 8



If the guessed letter is NOT there in the word:

"- - - - - -"

Your guessed letters so far: A
The number of guesses you still have: 7


If the number of guesses run out: 
"Sorry you have run out of guesses! The word is DESIRE"
